# Project Layout

**All source files go in the /Source folder**. Make sure that you put them there when you create new files with Visual Studio.

Every build file, intermediate file and so on goes in the /Build folder, you don't need to do anything for that, it will happen automatically.

If you're looking for the executable, for example if you want to share the game with someone, build in **Release** mode and you van find it in **/Build/Release/raylib_template.exe**
